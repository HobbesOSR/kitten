o This library currently is space-sharing only

o Some more pretty printing is needed

o Strange intermittent MPI_COMM_ERR appears in some MPI_Comm_rank call?  Not sure
  which.  It started appearing after I added a PMPI_Comm_rank( split_comm, srank )
  call inside the MPI_Init stanza in wrapper.w.  Not seen in a while, but keep your
  eyes open

o Verbose is not *ever* set in applications ranks, even if it is set in the
  environment
