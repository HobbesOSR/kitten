config DEBUG_KERNEL
	bool "Kernel debugging"
	help
	  Say Y here if you are developing drivers or trying to debug and
	  identify kernel problems.

config LOG_BUF_SHIFT
	int "Kernel log buffer size (16 => 64KB, 17 => 128KB)" if DEBUG_KERNEL
	range 12 21
	default 15
	help
	  Select kernel log buffer size as a power of 2.
	  Defaults and Examples:
	  	     17 => 128 KB
		     16 => 64 KB
	             15 => 32 KB
	             14 => 16 KB
		     13 =>  8 KB
		     12 =>  4 KB

config DEBUG_MUTEXES
	bool "Mutex debugging, deadlock detection"
	default n
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	 This allows mutex semantics violations and mutex related deadlocks
	 (lockups) to be detected and reported automatically.

config DEBUG_SPINLOCK
	bool "Spinlock debugging"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Say Y here and build SMP to catch missing spinlock initialization
	  and certain other kinds of spinlock errors commonly made.  This is
	  best used in conjunction with the NMI watchdog so that spinlock
	  deadlocks are also debuggable.

config DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP
	bool "Sleep-inside-spinlock checking"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  If you say Y here, various routines which may sleep will become very
	  noisy if they are called with a spinlock held.

config DEBUG_BUGVERBOSE
	bool "Verbose BUG() reporting (adds 70K)" if DEBUG_KERNEL && EMBEDDED
	depends on BUG
	depends on ARM || ARM26 || M32R || M68K || SPARC32 || SPARC64 || X86_32 || FRV
	default !EMBEDDED
	help
	  Say Y here to make BUG() panics output the file name and line number
	  of the BUG call as well as the EIP and oops trace.  This aids
	  debugging but costs about 70-100K of memory.

config DEBUG_INFO
	bool "Compile the kernel with debug info"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
          If you say Y here the resulting kernel image will include
	  debugging info resulting in a larger kernel image.
	  Say Y here only if you plan to debug the kernel.

	  If unsure, say N.

config FRAME_POINTER
	bool "Compile the kernel with frame pointers"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	default y if DEBUG_INFO && UML
	help
	  If you say Y here the resulting kernel image will be slightly larger
	  and slower, but it might give very useful debugging information on
	  some architectures or if you use external debuggers.
	  If you don't debug the kernel, you can say N.

config UNWIND_INFO
	bool "Compile the kernel with frame unwind information"
	depends on !IA64
	depends on !MODULES || !(MIPS || PARISC || PPC || SUPERH || V850)
	help
	  If you say Y here the resulting kernel image will be slightly larger
	  but not slower, and it will give very useful debugging information.
	  If you don't debug the kernel, you can say N, but we may not be able
	  to solve problems without frame unwind information or frame pointers.

config FORCED_INLINING
	bool "Force gcc to inline functions marked 'inline'"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	default y
	help
	  This option determines if the kernel forces gcc to inline the functions
	  developers have marked 'inline'. Doing so takes away freedom from gcc to
	  do what it thinks is best, which is desirable for the gcc 3.x series of
	  compilers. The gcc 4.x series have a rewritten inlining algorithm and
	  disabling this option will generate a smaller kernel there. Hopefully
	  this algorithm is so good that allowing gcc4 to make the decision can
	  become the default in the future, until then this option is there to
	  test gcc for this.
