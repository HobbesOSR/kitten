Quick Start:
    make config  (or make menuconfig)
    make isoimage
    qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom arch/x86_64/boot/image.iso -serial stdio -smp 4

    To boot on PC hardware with grub:
       kernel image: ./arch/x86_64/boot/bzImage
       initrd:       ./init_task

    To boot on Cray XT:
       kernel image: ./vmlwk.bin
       initrd:       ./init_task

Overview:
    Kitten is a lightweight kernel (LWK) operating system designed to be used
    on the compute nodes of distributed memory supercomputers.  At this point,
    Kitten is still, well, a kitten, but eventually our intent is to use it on
    systems consisting of tens or hundreds of thousands of multi-core,
    multi-socket compute nodes (i.e., mega-core systems).  Kitten's design goal
    is to enable applications to scale to significantly higher node counts and
    perform better than is possible with general-purpose operating systems, 
    such as Linux.  Kitten is based on Linux in part, but makes different
    design choices that are targeted at scalability (low noise, deterministic
    performance) and performance (physically contiguous memory layout,
    transparent large pages, novel memory mapping techniques for multi-core
    processors (SMARTMAP)).

    Please see our wiki at http://software.sandia.gov/trac/kitten for more
    information.

Features:
    * Open Source (GPL)
    * New LWK codebase partially derived from Linux, familiar organization
      and build process
    * Fully symmetric kernel, locking used to protect shared data
    * Multiple processes and threads per core
    * Partial Linux ABI support (what matters, similar to IBM's CNK)
    * User-space uses standard system Glibc
    * Guest OS support (when linked with the V3VEE project's
      Palacios hypervisor, http://v3vee.org/download)
    * lwIP TCP/IP stack (http://www.sics.se/~adam/lwip/) with
      ne2k and SeaStar drivers

Platforms Supported:
    Emulators:
