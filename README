Quick Start
===========
    make config  (or make menuconfig)
    make isoimage
    qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom arch/x86_64/boot/image.iso -serial stdio -smp 4

    What you should see:
        A bunch of kernel initialization messages print to the console,
        followed by:

            <6>Loading initial user-level task (init_task)...
            <0>Unhandled Interrupt! (vector=52, isa_irq=4)
            <8>(init_task) Hello, world!
            <8>(init_task) Arguments:
            <8>(init_task)   argv[0] = init_task
            <8>(init_task)   argv[1] = one
            <8>(init_task)   argv[2] = two
            <8>(init_task)   argv[3] = three
            <8>(init_task) Environment Variables:
            <8>(init_task)   envp[0] = one=1
            <8>(init_task)   envp[1] = two=2
            <8>(init_task)   envp[2] = three=3
            [... A bunch of test messages, ommitted here]
            <8>(init_task) Spinning forever...
            <8>(cpu0-task)    Meow!
            <8>(init_task)    Meow!
            <8>(cpu1-task)    Meow!
            <8>(cpu2-task)    Meow!
            <8>(cpu3-task)    Meow!

        The source code for the hello world init_task is at
        user/hello_world/hello_world.c
 

Overview
========
    Kitten is a lightweight kernel (LWK) operating system designed to be used
    on the compute nodes of distributed memory supercomputers. At this point,
    Kitten is, well, still a kitten, but eventually our intent is for it to
    be used on systems consisting of tens or hundreds of thousands of
    multi-socket, multi-core compute nodes (i.e., mega-core systems). The
    primary goal of Kitten is to enable supercomputer applications to scale
    to significantly higher node counts and perform substantially better
    than is possible with general-purpose compute node operating systems,
    such as Linux. Kitten is based on Linux in part, but makes different
    design choices that are targeted at scalability (low noise, deterministic
    behavior) and performance (physically contiguous memory layout,
    transparent large pages, novel techniques for taking better advantage of
    multi-core processors, like SMARTMAP).

    Please see our wiki at http://software.sandia.gov/trac/kitten for more
    information.

    Features:
        * Open Source (GPL)
        * New LWK codebase partially derived from Linux, familiar
          organization and build process
        * Fully symmetric kernel, locking used to protect shared data
        * Multiple processes and threads per core
        * Partial Linux ABI support (what matters, similar to IBM's CNK)
        * User-space uses standard system Glibc
        * SMARTMAP memory mapping (see SC08 paper) to enable single-copy
          intra-node MPI messaging. This significantly reduces intra-node
          memory bandwidth requirements.
        * Guest OS support (when linked with the V3VEE project's
          Palacios hypervisor, http://v3vee.org/download)
        * lwIP TCP/IP stack (http://www.sics.se/~adam/lwip/) with
          ne2k and SeaStar drivers
