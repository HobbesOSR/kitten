/* Overview
 *
 * EDF Scheduling
 *
 * The EDF scheduler uses a dynamic calculated priority as scheduling criteria to 
 * choose * what thread (e.g. Kitten task or Palacios vcore) will be scheduled. That
 * priority is calculated according with the relative deadline of the threads that 
 * are ready to run in the runqueue. This runqueue is a per-CPU data structure used 
 * to keep the runnable threads allocated to that CPU. The threads with less time 
 * before its deadline will receive better priorities. The runqueue is sorted each 
 * time that a thread becomes runnable or when its period is over. At that time the 
 * thread is enqueue. A new scheduling decision is taken each time that an 
 * interrupt is received. At that time if the earliest deadline thread is different
 * that the current thread, the current thread goes to sleep and the earliest 
 * deadline thread is woken up. Each time a thread is scheduled, the parameter 
 * "used_time" is set to zero and the current deadline is calculated using its 
 * period. One thread uses at least slice seconds of CPU. Some extra time may be 
 * allocated to that virtual core after all the other virtual cores consumes their 
 * slices.
